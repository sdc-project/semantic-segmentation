# semantic-segmentation
Bottom up technique for semantic segmentation

# some implementation ideas

* Take JS implementation to Python
* Test speed detection using Python given a sample image
* Read SYNTHIA dataset
* Create a custom loss function for unsupervised algorithm based on IoU
* Use several image repesentations (HSV, etc.) (Take in count that we should use some kind of normalization within those representations)
* Integrate with some classifier (just for now with XGBoost) for test
